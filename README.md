# LaTeX Docker Template

This repository is a template for writing LaTeX documents in a Dockerized environment with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Why does this exist?

This is mostly a test on using the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in VS Code.

I want to make a Docker template for writing and compiling LaTeX documents with [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). This work is inspired by [latex-docker](https://github.com/blang/latex-docker), another repository that similarly Dockerizes the LaTeX environment. I'm writing this specifically to enhance my knowledge about Docker and offline LaTeX writing and management.

## Intended use

Fork the repository for yourself and use VS Code as a LaTeX development environment. The [.vscode](.vscode) and [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) folders set up the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension for use.
